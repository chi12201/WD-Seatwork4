In the compact construction series with transversely mounted engine, a multi-disc clutch with hydraulic actuation and electronic control is mounted on the rear axle. The multi-disc clutch is located on the front axle in the R8 mid-engine sports car. These active systems distribute the forces variably to both axles depending on the driving situation.

                            The self-locking centre differential, which is used in many Audi models with a front-mounted longitudinal engine, is a purely mechanical epicyclic gear.</span>
